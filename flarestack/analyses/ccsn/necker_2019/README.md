Name: Core Collapse Supernova Analysis
Analyser: Jannis Necker (updated) Alex Stasik (original)

Datasets: ps_tracks (v002_p01)

This analysis was originally performed by Alexander Stasik, using three CCSNe
catalogues with multiple time PDFs. Both fixed weight analyses, as
well as weight-fitting analyses, were performed. The full CCSN
catalogues were split by cumulative weight assuming an E^-2 spectrum,
with a nearby sample containing 70% of the weight being analysed
separately from the remaining 30%. Individual analyses on specific CCSNe were
also performed.
