Unblinding Date: 01 Nov 2018, 06 Dec 2018

Datasets: ps_tracks (v002_p01) and gfu (v002_p01), gfu (v002_p04)

This analysis used four TDE catalogues, and performed a stacking analysis used
the "fitting weights" method. It also selected four individual TDEs, and
performs a flare search analysis on each of them. The results summary can be
found in a neutrino sources call.

This analysis found no significant correlation between TDEs and neutrinos. Upper
 limits were accordingly derived, and using tde_cosmology, diffuse flux
 constraints calculated.

Shortly after unblinding, new GFU data became available. Accordingly, AT2018cow
was added as a source for the flare search, in order to provide a timely IceCube
 analysis of this source. The new data set was added to the code, and a new
 Flarestack v1.2.1 (Asteria) release was made. No significant excess was
 observed from this source.
