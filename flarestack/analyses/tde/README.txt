This analysis used four TDE catalogues, and performed a stacking analysis used
the "fitting weights" method. It also selected four individual TDEs, and
performs a flare search analysis on each of them. The results summary can be
found in a neutrino sources call.

This analysis found no significant correlation between TDEs and neutrinos. Upper
 limits were accordingly derived, and using tde_cosmology, diffuse flux
 constraints calculated.
