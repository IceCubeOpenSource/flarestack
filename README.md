# flarestack
Code for unbinned likelihood analysis of astroparticle physics data.

Perform single source analyses, as well as stacking of sources according to predefined weighting. 
Also performs stacking analyses where the signal strength of each source is fit individually.

Additionally includes a "flare-search" algorithm to find event clustering in time as well as space.
